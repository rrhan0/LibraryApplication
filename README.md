# *Library Management Application*

## Proposal

***Description***
- *What will the application do?*
  - This application will provide users with the tools to organize and manage a library of books/ebooks/audiobooks.
  - You'll be allowed to add books to a library, see the contents of the books, edit the contents of the books, delete
    books from the library, and query for the books and sort them, borrow and put books on hold, and many other things 
    a library
    might require like signing out books by barcode, returning books, ordering books, maybe even selling books.
- *Who will use it?*
  - Anyone who has an interest in managing many books like librarians, book shops, and book collectors.
- *Why is this project of interest to you?*
  - I believe that this would be a good opportunity for learning. I think this would be a very practical project that
    has a very clear use. I believe that this would also be relevant to employers
    This project would help me practice create, read, update, delete operations. I think that working with databases is
    interesting, especially representing that database with an interface. I also enjoy reading and listening to books.
